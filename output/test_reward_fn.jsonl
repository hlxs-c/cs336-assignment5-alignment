James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, how many Facebook friends does James have?\nAssistant: <think>", "answer": "16", "response": " Okay, here is the reasoning process:\n\nFirst, let's find out how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write the equation: 3 * (Dorothy's friends) = 12. Solving for Dorothy's friends, we get: Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3 = 4.\n\nNow that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write the equation: James's friends = 4 * (Dorothy's friends) = 4 * 4 = 16.\n\n </think> <answer> James has 16 Facebook friends </answer>", "reward": {"format_reward": 1.0, "answer_reward": 0.0, "reward": 0.0}}
